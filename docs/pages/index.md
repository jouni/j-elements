Jelly is a web development research project, looking at some of the current problems around authoring and using Web Components and how to provide solutions to those problems while browsers improve their capabilities.

It also includes a collection or ready-to-use web components which test the solutions first-hand.

The package has zero dependencies and is about <module-size></module-size> in total including all components, utilities and CSS.

> Since it’s research project, **Jelly is not recommended for production use**. It is mainly looking for feedback from other developers, if the concepts are viable for production. See [Maturity Levels](/maturity) for more info.

## Browser support
The components and utilities support evergreen browsers. Internet Explorer or pre-Chromium Edge (versions before 76) are not supported.

## Versioning

Jelly does not follow semantic versioning entirely. During the 0.x versions, all minor version updates are considered breaking. Patch versions (0.x.y) can contain bug fixes as well as new features but are backwards compatible.

If the project ever “graduates” to a 1.0, then semantic versioning will be followed.
