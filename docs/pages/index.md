JElements is a web development research project by Jouni Koivuviita, looking at some of the current problems around authoring and using web components and how to provide solutions to those problems while browsers improve their capabilities.

The focus of this project is mostly on how to improve the Vaadin design system and web components in the future, and more specifically on the theming and styling aspects of them.

> ##### JElements is not recommended for production use
> The project is mainly looking for feedback from other developers, if the problems/issues are valid and if the proposed solutions are good enough to be considered as a way forward.
> [Please provide feedback via GitHub](https://github.com/jouni/j-elements)

## Browser support
The components and utilities support evergreen browsers. Internet Explorer or pre-Chromium Edge (versions before 76) are not supported.

## Versioning

JElements does not follow semantic versioning entirely. During the 0.x versions, all minor version updates are considered breaking. Patch versions (0.x.y) can contain bug fixes as well as new features but are backwards compatible.

If the project ever “graduates” to a 1.0, then semantic versioning will be followed.
