## Levels

### Proof of concept

The component/utility is testing a concept, a solution to a specific problem, hoping to spark further discussion to find out the benefits and drawbacks of the solution.

The component/utility is not recommended to be used directly in any production app, as it has not been thoroughly tested.

### Preview

The component/utility is in early stage development, and likely to go through major changes. The idea is that it will eventually be suitable for production use, once it has gone through proper testing and feedback rounds. Feedback about the API, performance and user experience is welcomed.

### Beta

The component/utility seems to solve a specific problem and the solution looks like the right one. Now it’s time to try it out in a real application and provide feedback about any bugs or other shortcomings.

### Stable

The component/utility has been tested and found to be a good solution and suitable for production use. There are no large issues regarding it’s use.

### Deprecated

The component/utility did not evolve into a really useful thing, and the development of it has been discontinued.
