# Jelly

Jelly is a web development research project, looking at some of the current problems around authoring and using web components and how to provide solutions to those problems while the browsers improve their capabilities.

It also includes a collection or ready-to-use web components which test the solutions first-hand.

> **Not recommended for production**, but very much recommended for testing and providing feedback ðŸ˜Š
